            [00:00] Hello, this is John from TechCorp. Thanks for taking my call.
            [00:05] Hi John, this is Sarah. What can I help you with today?
            [00:10] We're looking for a solution to help with our lead generation process.
            [00:15] That's great! We specialize in exactly that. Can you tell me more about your current process?
            [00:20] Right now we're using spreadsheets and it's getting out of hand.
            [00:25] I understand. How many leads are you processing per month?
            [00:30] About 500-1000 leads, but we're only converting about 5%.
            [00:35] That's actually quite common. Our clients typically see 15-20% conversion rates.
            [00:40] That sounds promising. What's the investment like?
            [00:45] Our packages start at $2,000/month for up to 1,000 leads.
            [00:50] That's within our budget. When could we get started?
            [00:55] We could have you up and running within 2 weeks. Would you like to schedule a demo?
            [01:00] Yes, that would be great. How about next Tuesday at 2pm?
            [01:05] Perfect! I'll send you a calendar invite. Thanks for your time today.
            [01:10] Thank you, Sarah. Looking forward to the demo.
